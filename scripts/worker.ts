 * Background Job Worker
 *
 * This script runs the BullMQ workers to process background jobs.
 * Run this as a separate process alongside your Next.js app.
 * Loads .env.local so GEMINI_API_KEY and other vars are available.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   pnpm worker          # Start workers
 *   npx tsx scripts/worker.ts
 *
 * In production, run this as a separate service/container.
